# Cooperation_and_Supernatural_Punishment
This repository contains the codes used in the manuscript on the evolution of cooperation and supernatural punishment (Shibasaki et al. 2024, in prep).

The Jupyter Notebook provides the codes for the numerical simulations of the evolutionary dynamics and visualization of them.

The R markdown is provided for the visualization of the parameter space. The data for the plots are available in the csv files.
